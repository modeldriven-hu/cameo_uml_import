# cameo_uml_import
A new project to import Cameo/MagicDraw files for CI/CD purposes

# Download libraries

Sadly, the Eclipse project does not support installing libraries using maven, therefore
you need to download the latest jar files from the following link, and use them as 
local dependencies. Yes, it is really annoying.

You can download dependencies from here (one by one)

https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/uml2/updates/5.5/

Or from here (you can download an all-in-one package)

https://eclipse.dev/modeling/mdt/downloads/?project=uml2
